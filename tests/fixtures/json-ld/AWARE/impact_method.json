In May 2016, the method was also endorsed by the EU Joint Research Center. AWARE is to be used as a water use midpoint indicator representing the relative Available WAter REmaining per area in a watershed after the demand of humans and aquatic ecosystems has been met. It assesses the potential of water deprivation, to either humans or ecosystems, building on the assumption that the less water remaining available per area, the more likely another user will be deprived. It is first calculated as the water Availability Minus the Demand (AMD) of humans and aquatic ecosystems and is relative to the area (m3 m-2 month-1). In a second step, the value is normalized with the world average result (AMD = 0.0136 m3 m-2 month-1) and inverted. The result represents the relative value in comparison with the average m3 consumed in the world (the world average is calculated as a consumption-weighted average). The indicator is limited to a range from 0.1 to 100, with a value of 1 corresponding to the world average, and a value of 10, for example, representing a region where there is 10 times less available water remaining per area than the world average. Documentation is available from: http://www.wulca-waterlca.org. PLEASE NOTE! Implementation of AWARE includes only the generic factors for unknown water usage and not the factors specific for agricultural and non-agricultural use of water (irrigation/non-irrigation, these are currently not supported the inventory data). The second set can be used to reduce uncertainty when specific watershed or month is not known, based on the activity's water use pattern. The full version of the method, including those additional flows, both in the flow-based and in the parametrized version can be downloaded from http://www.openlca.org/download/ and imported as a JSON-LD in openLCA. Note that this is only useful if you have data available in your model that support the additional flows. \r\nAdaptations by PR\u00e9 Consultants: 7 aluminium producing regions were included in order to fit the inventories. They were given the factors of the following regions: IAI Area, Africa -> Africa IAI Area; Asia, without China and GCC -> Asia; IAI Area, EU27 & EFTA -> Europe; IAI Area, Gulf Cooperation Council -> Middle East; IAI Area, North America, without Quebec -> North America; IAI Area, Russia & RER w/o EU27 & EFTA -> Europe; IAI Area, South America -> South America. \r\nOther adaptations (September 2018, version 1.02): (i) Added characterisation factors for the following geographies: NORDEL, UCTE, UCTE without Germany, WEU; (ii) Corrected all characterisation factors to include four significant digits. Other adaptation (March 2017, version 1.01): (i) Changed the subcompartment for the Raw materials - from 'in water' to '(unspecified)'. (ii) Added the Waterborne emissions flows for subcompartment 'ocean' with factor 0.\r\nMethod checked against SimaPro 9.0.0.30.", "version": "00.00.029", "lastChange": "2019-09-28T09:16:32.901+02:00", "impactCategories": [{"@type": "ImpactCategory", "@id": "2e0e479e-6ea7-3221-88ea-41aa6530c5d2", "name": "Water use", "refUnit": "m3"}]}
